# HangmanGame
Implemented the classic Hangman game in Java. Handles user input, reads a dictionary text file and utilizes Javaâ€™s random module to randomly select a word from the text file, and stores words into an ArrayList. 
Implemented boolean logic, while loops, and if conditions to construct the foundational structure of the Hangman game code, creating interactive gameplay through effective handling of user inputs and game state.
